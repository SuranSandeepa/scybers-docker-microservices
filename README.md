## About ðŸš€  

This project demonstrates containerized microservices using Docker and Docker Compose. It includes a **Node.js** service (exposed to the outside), a **Python** service (accessible only within the network), and a **MongoDB** database (restricted to internal access). The Node.js service communicates with both the Python service and MongoDB, ensuring secure and isolated interactions between the containers. This setup tests Docker networking, service isolation, and basic DevOps principles.
